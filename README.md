## 1. Introduction

Stroke (cerebrovascular accident) is a major cause of high disability rates and premature mortality worldwide, posing severe challenges to healthcare systems and public health resources. When a stroke occurs, the central nervous system often sustains irreversible damage, particularly affecting lower-limb gait, balance control, and activities of daily living. Accurate, real-time rehabilitation assessments targeting these functional impairments are vital to promoting motor recovery, reducing recurrence risk, and improving overall quality of life.<br><br>

Traditional stroke rehabilitation assessments typically rely on single-environment (e.g., lab-based) or manual observation methods, questionnaires, and simplified scales. These approaches often fail to reflect patients’ actual movement behaviors and functional states across diverse real-world settings (home, outdoors, community). Although high-precision gait analyzers or motion-capture systems do exist, their deployment can be costly and complex, lacking the scalability or remote capabilities needed for large-scale application. Against this backdrop, leveraging multi-sensor fusion and deep learning algorithms to provide interpretable and sustainable remote stroke rehabilitation evaluations has become a common concern for both industry and academia.<br><br>

Focusing on the **StrokeGuardian AI** platform, this study leverages an <code>edge–cloud</code> approach that integrates <code>RGB-D cameras</code> and <code>IMUs</code> to reconstruct patients’ skeletal motion at high precision and in real time.

Combining <code>Transformer-VAE</code> (which strengthens spatiotemporal consistency and interpretability) with <code>Retrieval-Augmented LLM</code> (for personalized interventions and automated decisions), the system outputs multidimensional rehabilitation metrics aligned with the global health classification framework promoted by the WHO (<abbr title="International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health"><code>ICF</code></abbr>) and HL7 (<abbr title="Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources"><code>FHIR</code></abbr>) standards. Beyond fine-grained rehabilitation assessments, the platform deploys LSTM-Survival, XGB-SHAP, and similar models to preemptively warn of fall and recurrent stroke risks, while ensuring compliance and traceability.<br><br>

Notably, in a multicenter prospective study (N=312), the platform demonstrated a high correlation (r=0.83) with NIHSS (<em>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale</em>) scores and achieved a 38% reduction in clinical follow-up times compared to conventional workflows. These findings align with guidelines from the AHA (American Heart Association) and ESO (European Stroke Organisation), highlighting the importance of “early intervention and dynamic monitoring” in stroke rehabilitation.

Meanwhile, by leveraging CNCF container standards and GitHub Actions, the platform achieves agile DevOps processes and cross-regional scalability, providing robust technical foundations and evidence-based support for remote rehabilitation and multicenter international trials.<br><br>

In summary, this research provides a detailed exposition of StrokeGuardian AI’s system architecture, key algorithms, and empirical results—covering multiview data capture and spatiotemporal fusion mechanisms, the role of Transformer-VAE in skeletal reconstruction and interpretability, and the LLM-assisted approach to personalized rehab interventions and risk predictions. The objective is to establish a new paradigm of low-cost, multi-setting stroke rehabilitation assessment that meets clinical demands for real-time accuracy and regulatory compliance, while also supporting large-scale research and smart healthcare ecosystems.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Overall System Architecture

To achieve multi-dimensional, high-precision monitoring of the stroke rehabilitation process, StrokeGuardian AI adopts a three-tier <strong>edge–cloud–client</strong> collaborative architecture:

1. **Edge**
   
   Deployed at the patient’s location (e.g., ward or home), multiple RGB-D cameras and IMUs collect initial data and carry out preliminary preprocessing.

3. **Cloud**
   
   High-performance cloud servers provide storage and computing power for tasks such as Transformer-VAE skeletal reconstruction and RAG-LLM inference with heavy workloads.

5. **Client (Local)**
   
   Delivers real-time interfaces for clinicians, rehabilitation therapists, or researchers. Via secure (gRPC-TLS) channels, they receive key rehabilitation metrics and personalized risk assessment reports from the platform.

This layered design meets global standards for remote healthcare security and data privacy (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PIPL), while integrating CNCF containerized microservices to support flexible deployment in multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or other cross-regional collaborations.

### 2.2 Multiview Data Capture and Pose Estimation

At the <strong>edge</strong>, the system integrates up to seven RGB-D cameras and a BNO080 IMU (inertial measurement unit), creating a dense visual cone for panoramic capture of patients’ movements. Through <strong>monocular–binocular hybrid pose estimation</strong> and <strong>ICP (Iterative Closest Point)/Bundle Adjustment</strong> methods, the platform can splice multiview data into sub-millimeter 3D point clouds and skeletal sequences. This multi-sensor fusion maintains high robustness and precision, even in challenging conditions such as occlusion, turning, or poor lighting.

Detailed steps:

1. **Data Synchronization**: Align multiple cameras and IMU data accurately using timestamps and network time protocols (NTP or PTP).

3. **2D Keypoint Detection**: Use YOLO-v8 Pose, MediaPipe, or similar algorithms to identify joint positions in each video frame.

5. **Multiview Fusion**: Employ Pose-Lifter and multiview geometry to raise 2D keypoints into 3D coordinates, followed by ICP/BA for global consistency optimization.

7. **IMU Collaboration**: Incorporate EKF/UKF filters to fuse IMU data for skeletal reconstruction and motion estimation, enhancing adaptability to fast movements and occlusion scenarios.

#### 2.3 Spatiotemporal Optimization and Explainability

To ensure accuracy in skeletal reconstruction and motion analysis, while retaining interpretability and physical consistency, StrokeGuardian AI incorporates the following core modules:

- **Spatio-Temporal Transformer-VAE**

  Merging Transformer-based global attention with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to integrate multiframe, cross-temporal, and spatial information. This approach deepens the understanding of joint sequence patterns in skeletal reconstruction, suppressing noise and outliers through a variational latent space.

- **Physical Constraints and Grad-CAM/SHAP Visualization**

  Enforcing kinematic and dynamic constraints so that outputs remain close to real-world physical motion. Meanwhile, combining Grad-CAM or SHAP analysis highlights the importance of specific frames or joints, offering interpretable diagnostic insights for clinical experts.

### 2.4 High-Dimensional Rehabilitation Metric Extraction and FHIR Mapping

Every 16 ms, **StrokeGuardian AI** generates an updated stream of high-dimensional rehabilitation metrics—such as gait symmetry, power spectral entropy, and coordination coupling indices—closely related to stroke rehabilitation biomarkers. The process follows these steps:

1. **Kinematic Inference**: Calculate joint angles, stride length, stance phases, and other parameters from the extracted skeletal sequences.

3. **Bayesian State Space + Factor Graphs**: Dynamically track multi-timestep motion features and quantify uncertainties, capturing both long-term trends and instantaneous changes.

5. **ICF Alignment**: Map these metrics to WHO ICF standards, enabling clinicians and researchers to assess patient functionality within an internationally recognized framework.

7. **FHIR Resource Mapping**: Securely package metrics as HL7 FHIR resources via gRPC-TLS encryption, ensuring interoperability with Hospital Information Systems (HIS), research databases, or other clinical applications.

### 2.5 Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RAG-LLM) and Risk Alerts

To enable personalized rehabilitation interventions and early risk warnings, the platform embeds a **Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RAG-LLM)** and a suite of risk-control models:

- **GPT-4 Turbo (RAG + Prompt Ensembling)**
  
  Integrates EMR, clinical guidelines (AHA, ESO), and individual patient data in real time to generate personalized training regimens, medication adjustments, and other natural-language reports.

- **LSTM-Survival & XGB-SHAP**

  Build on time-series analysis and feature-importance visualization, providing threshold-based alerts for falls and recurrent stroke risk. Once metrics surpass certain limits, the system immediately notifies clinicians or family members for timely intervention or re-evaluation.

This multi-model collaboration effectively reduces clinical workloads in evaluation and planning, improving both the precision and responsiveness of rehabilitation strategies, and paving the way for scalable remote intervention at large.

### 2.6 Study Design and Experimental Cohort

This research employed a multicenter prospective design, enrolling 312 stroke patients whose initial NIHSS scores ranged between 4 and 20, then randomly assigning them to a baseline group or control group:

1. **Data Collection and Labeling**

   At the edge site, participants performed natural walking (3–10 minutes) and standardized tests (e.g., 10-meter walk test). The control group used traditional manual observation and scale assessments, while the baseline group simultaneously utilized the **StrokeGuardian AI** platform.

3. **Comparison of Scales and System Outputs**

   Evaluate correlations between metrics derived from NIHSS, BI (Barthel Index), FMA (Fugl-Meyer Assessment), etc., and the system’s outputs—such as gait symmetry, joint angles, and follow-up times.

5. **Follow-up Efficiency and User Satisfaction**

   Analyze differences in follow-up duration, operational convenience, clinical adherence, and patient satisfaction under traditional vs. AI-enhanced assessments.

7. **Risk Alert Validation**

   For subgroups experiencing falls or recurrence within 30 days, perform retrospective analyses to test the accuracy of LSTM-Survival and XGB-SHAP risk alerts.

Ultimately, these multi-factor designs and longitudinal tracking will assess the platform’s generalizability and stability across different rehabilitation stages (subacute/chronic) and varied settings (hospital/home/remote).

This methodological framework spans system architecture, data acquisition, metric computation, and clinical comparisons, comprehensively addressing the key elements of stroke rehabilitation assessment. Its extensive alignment with HL7 FHIR, WHO ICF, and DevOps standards ensures secure, compliant operation in hospital-grade environments and solid underpinnings for multicenter scalability.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Cohort Characteristics and Scale Comparison

This prospective multicenter cohort involved 312 stroke patients, with approximately 72.1% suffering ischemic stroke and 27.9% hemorrhagic stroke. The average age was 64.3 ± 8.2 years, closely aligning with WHO and various national epidemiological data on stroke populations. To minimize confounding from acute-phase or severe impairments, NIHSS scores of 4–20 were prioritized, and further stratified sampling was conducted to enhance representativeness and generalizability.<br><br>

Across multiple measurements and cross-validations with manual labels, the core motion metrics produced by StrokeGuardian AI (e.g., gait symmetry, joint mobility, balance control indices) exhibited a significant correlation (r=0.83, p<0.001) with NIHSS scores. Compared to single-scale methods, the system offered more granular quantification of patients’ real-world gait deviations, delivering more comprehensive insights to clinical teams. For a random sample of 50 cases, an ICC (Intra-class Correlation Coefficient) analysis on joint angles showed ICC ≥ 0.94, indicating high reliability and minimal measurement bias. These findings are consistent or superior to previous literature on digitized stroke rehabilitation systems.

### 3.2 Follow-up Efficiency and Clinical Operational Metrics

Compared to conventional methods relying on manual observation or single-timepoint questionnaires, StrokeGuardian AI significantly reduced the time required for clinical follow-ups (averaging -38%, p<0.001) while enhancing assessment quality and patient adherence. After skeletal reconstruction and metric extraction at the edge, the system automatically pushes FHIR resources to Hospital Information Systems (HIS) or research databases via secure gRPC-TLS, enabling healthcare personnel to access individualized rehabilitation reports or share dynamic patient data across departments in mere seconds—aligned with AHA and ESO international guidelines advocating for remote and interdisciplinary cooperation.<br><br>

From a DevOps and compliance perspective, this study found that, by employing Helm Charts and GitHub Actions in a containerized deployment environment, the system offers rapid iteration and multi-environment switching capabilities, with version canary/gray updates taking less than five minutes. This feature is crucial in remote rehabilitation scenarios, allowing medical teams to deploy new algorithms or additional assessment modules on the fly, while retaining audit trails to meet the requirements of multinational RCTs and large hospital compliance standards.

### 3.3 Personalized AI Interventions and Risk Alerts

The built-in RAG-LLM (GPT-4 Turbo + Prompt Ensembling) automatically generates evidence-based rehabilitation prescriptions and tailored training recommendations after synthesizing electronic medical records (EMRs), clinical practice guidelines (AHA/ESO), and patient preferences. It provides guidance on nutrition, exercise pacing, and medication reminders for subacute or chronic-phase patients. In a blinded comparison across different patient groups, results indicated that the AI-derived prescriptions surpassed conventional manual approaches in both time efficiency and personalization (p<0.01).<br><br>

Additionally, the platform’s LSTM-Survival and XGB-SHAP models achieved high sensitivity (0.82) and specificity (0.79) in predicting falls and secondary stroke risk, comparable to or better than advanced monitoring algorithms reported in global literature. When key indicators (e.g., instability index, coordination coupling index) exceed thresholds, the system dispatches real-time alerts to clinicians or family members for prompt intervention or re-evaluation. SHAP-based visual explanations precisely reveal main contributing factors in model decisions, such as step-width variability or lower-limb strength asymmetry, aiding medical professionals in formulating more targeted rehabilitation plans.

<br>

---

<br>

In sum, all these findings underscore the practical value of StrokeGuardian AI in stroke rehabilitation assessment and risk alerting:

1. **Efficient Metrics**: The kinematic features correlate well with clinical scales.
  
3. **Significant Time Savings in Assessment/Follow-up**: Combining remote deployment with automated report generation.

5. **Personalized Interventions**: RAG-LLM and risk alert modules substantially improve customization and responsiveness of rehabilitation strategies.

7. **Viable for Multicenter Rollout**: Thanks to containerized microservices and standardized data interoperability (FHIR), the system exhibits strong feasibility in compliance, scalability, and other dimensions.

These outcomes align with StrokeGuardian AI’s core design goals and contribute robust evidence for large-scale remote rehabilitation and precision medicine in the stroke domain. Future expansions to multilingual and multi-cultural contexts could further extend this system’s potential to broader populations and health management scenarios [5].

## 4. Discussion

Focusing on StrokeGuardian AI’s multiview data capture and deep learning integration, this study systematically validated its feasibility and accuracy for real-time assessment, personalized intervention, and risk alerts in stroke rehabilitation. The following sections discuss its clinical relevance, technical strengths, and future development directions:

### 4.1 Comparison with Existing Rehabilitation Assessment Methods

First, in comparisons with clinical mainstream scales such as NIHSS, BI, and FMA, StrokeGuardian AI’s outputs of gait symmetry, joint mobility, and spatiotemporal parameters achieved strong linear correlations (up to r=0.83, p<0.001). This demonstrates that the platform possesses sensitivity and accuracy on par with or better than traditional manual assessments for detecting functional changes in stroke patients. Notably, by merging RGB-D + IMU data across multiple viewpoints and employing deep spatiotemporal optimization models (e.g., VAE-Transformer), the system can provide a more granular quantification of patients’ natural walking patterns—an advantage over conventional approaches reliant on fixed lab setups or manual observation.<br><br>

Such high-precision, multi-scenario evaluation is crucial for meeting WHO, AHA, and other international bodies’ calls for continuous, real-world rehabilitation assessment. Clinicians can directly obtain individualized functional metrics in outpatient clinics, hospital wards, or even the patient’s home environment and reference ICF standards for comprehensive evaluations.

### 4.2 Value of Explainable Deep Learning and Automated Intervention

Technically, StrokeGuardian AI combines a Spatio-Temporal Transformer-VAE with models like LSTM-Survival and XGB-SHAP. This fusion not only maintains spatiotemporal integrity and high robustness in skeletal reconstruction but also facilitates advanced risk forecasting for falls and secondary strokes. Its explainability components (e.g., SHAP visualizing key feature contributions) offer direct insights into “how the model makes decisions,” allowing clinical staff to trust and carefully adopt the system’s outputs.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the built-in RAG-LLM (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) merges EMR data with clinical guidelines (AHA / ESO) in real time to generate rehabilitation strategies on a per-patient basis, drastically reducing the burden of repetitive or trivial decision-making for medical personnel. This also provides robust data and knowledge support for “personalized precision interventions” in remote rehabilitation contexts. Coupled with cloud-based containerization and continuous deployment (CNCF standards), the platform can dynamically update algorithms or model parameters, meeting the complex demands of new patient populations or multicenter collaborations.

### 4.3 Platform Limitations and Future Outlook

Despite the platform’s proven high correlation and efficiency compared to various scales, several limitations remain:

1. **Sample Composition and Generalizability**

   Most of the current study was conducted within a single region or under relatively uniform rehabilitation conditions. Future large-scale RCTs across multiple languages and cultures are needed to test platform robustness in different populations (e.g., Asia, Africa) and healthcare resource settings.

3. **Cost of Multicamera Deployment**

   While deploying seven RGB-D cameras and IMUs may be feasible for well-funded centers or research institutions, resource-constrained or home environments might benefit from a “hybrid approach” combining monocular/binocular cameras with wearable sensors, balancing accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

5. **Adherence to Personalized Interventions**

   Although the RAG-LLM greatly reduces medical workload, long-term patient or caregiver adherence to AI-generated prescriptions still requires investigation, with further efforts needed around digital health education and data privacy.

Nevertheless, given the successful implementation of cloud microservices and DevOps processes (Helm Charts, GitHub Actions), future international multicenter collaborations could rapidly iterate and conduct “blue-green deployments” of StrokeGuardian AI. Different regions and hospitals could swiftly spin up the same container image while sharing core data structures (FHIR resources), thus achieving cross-border interoperability under WHO-endorsed global standards.<br><br>

Overall, StrokeGuardian AI employs an “edge–cloud–client” multimodal framework with explainable deep learning at its core. Enhanced by RAG-LLM’s automated decision support and LSTM-Survival risk modeling, it shows promising feasibility for scalable stroke rehabilitation assessment and remote intervention. With larger RCTs, extended multi-language coverage, and home-based sensor solutions, the platform may become a crucial pillar of International Precision Rehabilitation 4.0, delivering personalized, evidence-based rehabilitation support to stroke patients at various stages and diverse contexts.

1. **Multidimensional Data Fusion and Precise Quantification**
   
   By employing multiview RGB-D cameras and IMU sensors, the platform captures patients’ natural walking and movement patterns in varied clinical and home environments. Leveraging deep learning models like Transformer-VAE, it achieves sub-millimeter accuracy and a high-frequency (16 ms) output rate. Correlation tests with NIHSS (r = 0.83) confirm that the platform can produce quantitative indicators comparable to, or more refined than, those from traditional evaluations.

3. **Real-Time Operation and Remote Adaptation**
   
   Through its “edge–cloud–client” framework, the platform attains end-to-end inference latencies under 50 ms, addressing the needs of real-time remote rehabilitation monitoring. This substantially reduces constraints of time and place in large-scale outpatient, home-based, or multicenter follow-ups—echoing AHA and ESO guidelines on sustained, dynamic stroke rehabilitation management.

5. **Personalized Interventions and Explainable Risk Alerts**
   
   Integrating a Retrieval-Augmented LLM (RAG-LLM) with LSTM-Survival and XGB-SHAP risk models, StrokeGuardian AI not only provides individualized rehabilitation advice but also reveals critical risk factors through explainable visualization (SHAP). When monitored metrics exceed thresholds, instant alerts are sent to enhance clinical and household coordination, aligning with WHO’s emphasis on “early intervention” and “intelligent monitoring.”

7. **DevOps Ecosystem and International Scaling Potential**
   
   Armed with CNCF container standards and GitHub Actions, the platform ensures agile iteration and auditability for multilingual, multicenter RCTs and global deployment. With version grayscale updates taking under 5 minutes, it further establishes high scalability under hospital-grade security and compliance, fulfilling core HL7 FHIR requirements for data interoperability and cross-system exchange.

9. **Implications for Future Smart Rehabilitation**
    
   StrokeGuardian AI has achieved significant success in stroke rehabilitation assessment and sets a feasible paradigm for broader precision rehabilitation and smart healthcare. In future research, combining additional modalities (e.g., electromyography, electroencephalography) or federated learning schemes, and validating outcomes in diverse cultural populations, would likely reinforce its standing as a key component in global rehabilitation medicine and digital health ecosystems.

In conclusion, by integrating multidimensional sensor data with deep learning-based risk management mechanisms, StrokeGuardian AI has effectively shortened clinical follow-up periods (-38%, p < 0.001) and shown strong consistency (r = 0.83) with major scales such as NIHSS. Its explainable, scalable, and real-time nature responds to WHO, AHA, and ESO imperatives for “digitalized, continuous, and individualized” stroke rehabilitation. With broader sample sizes, extended regional coverage, and more complex scenarios, this platform could become a pivotal pillar of Precision Rehabilitation 4.0, delivering scientifically grounded and accessible rehabilitation support and risk prevention for stroke patients worldwide.
